 *
 * This is a hard-macro analog submission: the GDS in gds/ is the design.
 * This stub exists only so the TT harness has a module to instantiate and
 * so precheck can confirm the power pins. There is no synthesisable logic
 * on this die and no clock of any kind - the only digital block, an
 * inverter strip, is purely combinational.
 *
 * Pinout
 *   ua[0]  VOUT     analog out  integrator output -> MCU ADC (12-bit)
 *   ua[1]  VCM      analog in   0.90 V mid-rail reference (must be driven)
 *   ui[0]  B0       in          charge-DAC code bit 0 (LSB)
 *   ui[1]  B1       in
 *   ui[2]  B2       in
 *   ui[3]  B3       in
 *   ui[4]  B4       in
 *   ui[5]  B5       in          charge-DAC code bit 5 (MSB)
 *   ui[6]  RST      in          integrator reset - hold high through power-up
 *   ui[7]  TRIGBC   in          fire cal step, ACTIVE LOW  (st -> 1.8 V)
 *   uio[0] TRIGBT   in          fire trim step, ACTIVE LOW (st -> vtrim)
 *   uio[1] TRIGN    in          step pull-down, HIGH = idle (st -> VSS)
 *   uio[2] S0       in          leak DAC decade select, 1 nA
 *   uio[3] S1       in          leak DAC decade select, 100 pA
 *   uio[4] S2       in          leak DAC decade select, 10 pA
 *
 * The b0..b5 complements are generated ON DIE by invstrip_v3, unlike V1
 * where the complements had to be driven from outside. Only b0..b5 are
 * needed on ui.
 *
 * S0/S1/S2 are three independent NMOS pass taps on one resistor divider.
 * They are one-hot BY CONVENTION ONLY - asserting two shorts two nodes of
 * the divider together. Firmware must enforce it.
 *
 * uo_out, uio_out and uio_oe are unused and are tied to VGND *in the GDS*
 * (a single met4 strap over the contiguous output pin block, dropped to the
 * VGND bus track). They are driven to 0 here as well so the Verilog view
 * agrees with the layout.
 *
 * uo_out[0] is included in that strap as of 2026-08-11. It had been left out
 * because the earlier tiles drove it with a comparator, which v3 moved off
 * chip; the strap now runs to x = 94.80 um and covers it. Verilog and layout
 * agree - all eight uo_out bits are 0 in both views.
